Now there is literally no excuse to forgetting to record demos.

Currently it's set to display 2 lines in chat at the start of every round.
If people find this useful I will go ahead and rework it to only display the text at the start of the first round, maybe even add more features in later on.


Potential Features:
add a "verify roster" feature (!verifyroster) 
Or have it pull up rules to help newer players who can't get a hold of an admin (!rules)


Chanlog:

1.1 major coding change.
(Majority of the credit going to Carbon of the AlliedModders forums for coming up with a neat script that only executes when both teams ready up and the round starts and only then.)
-Fixed up issues of the Reminder not kicking off
-Changed hsay to csay as csay overlayed on top of hud information making it difficult to read
-Added in a note on match end that players are to keep demos until the end of season

1.0 Initial Release
-Chat message reminding players to record POVs and punishment for not doing say
-Shortened csay varient of chat message
